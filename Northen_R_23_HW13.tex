\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] (4 points) Which of these stars will produce a planetary nebula. \\
\item[(b)] (4 points) Elements heavier than Carbon will be produced in which stars. \\
\end{itemize}



\item An electron is found to be in the spin state (in the \textit{z}-basis): $\chi=$A\begin{pmatrix} 3\textit{i}\\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] (5 points) Determine the possible values of \textsl{A} such that the state is normalized. \\
\item[(b)] (5 points) Find the expectation values of the operators {\color{red}$S_x$}, {\color{purple}$S_y$}, {\color{orange}$S_z$} and $\vec{S}^{2}$. \\
\end{itemize}

The matrix representations in the \textit{z}-basis for the components of electron spin operators are
given by: \\\\
{\color{red}\textbf{S$_x$}$ = $\scriptsize{$\dfrac{\hbar}{2}$}\normalsize{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}} {\color{purple};\quad\quad\quad\quad\textbf{S$_y$}$ = $\scriptsize{$\dfrac{\hbar}{2}$}\normalsize{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\textit{i}\\ \textit{i} & 0 \end{pmatrix}}} {\color{orange};\quad\quad\quad\quad\textbf{S$_z$}$ = $\scriptsize{$\dfrac{\hbar}{2}$}\normalsize{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}}} \\



\item The average electrostatic field in the earthâ€™s atmosphere in fair weather is approximately given: \\
\begin{equation}
\textit{$\vec{E}$} = \textit{E}_0\Bigl(\textit{Ae}^{-\alpha z}+\textit{Be}^{-\beta z}\Bigr)\hat{z},\\
\end{equation}

where A,B,$\alpha$,$\beta$ are positive constants and \textit{z} is the height above the (locally flat) earth surface.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] (5 points) Find the average charge density in the atmosphere as a function of height \\
\item[(b)] (5 points) Find the electric potential as a function height above the earth. \\
\end{itemize}
